D Diary
is an online journal for the IC that presents a daily writing prompt for users. (reminiscent of livejournal in the 2000's) Users can create written entries and read others entries. Users can receive tips in ckBTC, with future options for ckETH, ICP and DEAR.

## 📦 Create a New Project

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16` and [`dfx`](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.14` are installed on your system.

Run the following commands in a new, empty project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/daniamorris/ddiary.git # Download this project
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
dfx deps deploy # https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/cli-reference/dfx-deps/

npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings

npm start # Start the development server
```

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the Internet Computer.

## 💡 Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
